# FASTDATE

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to implement a fast divergence times estimation algorithm, based on the dynamic
programming algorithm by &Ouml;rjan  &Aring;kerborg (2008). The new tool should:

* have an open source code with an appropriate open source license.
* 64-bit multi-threaded design that handles very large datasets
* be as accurate or more accurate than current bayesian methods.
* implement a variety of fossil calibration methods, such as tip dating, node dating and possibly, the fossilized birth-death process (Heath et al. 2014).

## Compilation instructions

Currently, FASTDATE can be compiled using the included makefile:

`make`

## FASTDATE command line options

General options:

* `--help`
* `--version`
* `--divtimes`
* `--show-tree`

Input and output options:

* `--tree-file`
* `--out-file`

Model parameters:

* `--birth-rate`
* `--death-rate`
* `--edge-rate-mean`
* `--edge-rate-variance`

## Usage example

In the example below, we estimate the divergence times (`--divtimes`) of a
dataset using FASTDATE. We use a birth-death process with birth rate
(`--birth-rate`) 2 and death rate (`--death-rate`) 1. The prior for the edge
rates is a gamma distribution with mean (`--edge-rate-mean) 1 and variance
(`edge-rate-variance`) 1. We output a diagram of the tree with time estimates
on screen (`--show-tree`) and write the annotated file in newick format in a
file (`--out-file`).

`./fastdate --divtimes --show-tree --grid-intervals 100 --birth-rate 2 --death-rate 1 --edge-rate-mean 1 --edge-rate-variance 1 --tree-file tree.newick --out-file output.newick`
