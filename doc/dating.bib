abstract = {Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data—most commonly, fossil age estimates—are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the “fossilized birth–death” (FBD) process—a model for calibrating divergence time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and show that node age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We used this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus Ursus diversified in the Late Miocene to Middle Pliocene.},

abstract = {The importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of population growth was pointed out by W. Feller [1] in 1939. He considered among other examples the "birth-and-death" process in which the expected birth and death rates (per head of population per unit of time) were constants, λo and μo, say. In this paper, I shall give the complete solution of the equations governing the generalised birth-and-death process in which the birth and death rates λ(t) and μ(t) may be any specified functions of the time. The mathematical method employed starts from M. S. Bartlett's idea of replacing the differential-difference equations for the distribution of the population size by a partial differential equation for its generating function. For an account of this technique,1 reference may be made to Bartlett's North Carolina lectures [2]. The formulae obtained lead to an expression for the probability of the ultimate extinction of the population, and to the necessary and sufficient condition for a birth-and-death process to be of "transient" type. For transient processes the distribution of the cumulative population is also considered, but here in general it is not found possible to do more than evaluate its mean and variance as functions of t, although a complete solution (including the determination of the asymptotic form of the distribution as t tends to infinity) is obtained for the simple process in which the birth and death rates are independent of the time. It is shown that a birth-and-death process can be constructed to give an expected population size \${\textbackslash}bar n\_t\$ which is any desired function of the time t, and among the many possible solutions the unique one is determined which makes the fluctuation, Var(nt), a minimum for all. The general theory is illustrated with reference of two examples. The first of these is the (λ0, μ1t) process introduced by N. Arley [3] in his study of the cascade showers associated with cosmic radiation; here the birth rate is constant and the death rate is a constant multiple of the "age, t, of the process. The \${\textbackslash}bar n\_t\$ -curve is then Gaussian in form, and the process is always of transient type. The second example is provided by the family of "periodic" processes, in which the birth and death rates are periodic functions of the time t. These appear well adapted to describe the response of population growth (or epidemic spread) to the influence of the seasons.},
