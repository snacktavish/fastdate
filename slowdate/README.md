# SLOWDATE
`slowdate` is a Python (and therefore slow) implementation of the
speed dating approach. This is just intended as a testing tool, not
an implementation to be used for real analyses.

## installation
This tool depends on DendroPy version 4. To install that in a virtualenv:


    $ git clone https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/DendroPy.git
    $ virtualenv "$HOME/dendro-env"
    $ source "$HOME/dendro-env/bin/activate"
    $ cd DendroPy
    $ python setup.py develop
